The solution is to define the `mysteryFunction` before its use.  Here's the corrected code:

```haskell
mysteryFunction :: Int -> Int
mysteryFunction x = x * 2

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = mysteryFunction 5
  print result
```
This version explicitly defines `mysteryFunction`, preventing the runtime error.
